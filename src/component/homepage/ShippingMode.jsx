This option is normally efficient normally assuring that you’ll receive your shipment within 2 to 5 business days from collection, however the cost is higher compared to other options. </p>

                                    <p> Balancing speed and cost, air freight is a reliable choice. It’s perfect for time-sensitive shipments, small cargo, and fragile goods. This option normally takes 7-10 days to deliver. The cost of this option typically varies based on urgency, service levels and cargo weight with charges normally ranging between $5 to $10 per kilogram for a 200kg shipment. </p>

                                        <p> If you’re dealing with bulk goods, sea freight is your go-to option. Sea freight considers the option to make use of full container load shipping (FCL) or less than container load (LCL) shipping. The shared space approach works best for smaller packages and effectively allows you to pay for only the space used.  Shipping a 20ft container from the Port of Nansha to the Port of Durban might take +/- 23 days whilst an LCL takes 28-35 days. It’s cost-effective and reasonable in terms of transit times.</p>

                                        <h5>  Road Freight</h5>
                                        <p>  This option is essential for land connections. Road freight ensures efficient transportation within landscape, while rail freight offers an eco-friendly alternative. Dedicated full truck loads (FTL) are ideal for cargo that needs to move efficiently, whereas the option to consolidate less than truck loads (LTL) provide a cost cushion on smaller packages despite a slightly longer transit time.</p>
